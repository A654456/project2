        <p>Lionel Andrés Messi born (24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer
           who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team.
           Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards
           and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team.</p>

        <h2 id="h2">Barcelona</h2>
        <p>On 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player.
           It made him a Barcelona player until 2010,
           two years less than his previous contract,
           but his buyout clause increased to €150 million.</p>

        <p>After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, 
           who scored twice inside two minutes, 
           Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, 
           before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3–3 after extra-time, 
           the match went to a penalty shoot-out. 
           Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, 
           with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, 
           ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.</p>
